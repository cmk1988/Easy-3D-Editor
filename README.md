# Easy-3D-Editor
3D editor using cubes and spheres to create 3D objects. Exporting Wavefront obj files.

Please use v142 to build this project. For older buildtools there is a workaround to avoid errors: Split the modelviwer project in two DLL-projects (CLR and native C++).

## New features:
* 3D Window added (please use DirectX SDK to build)
* Shader compiling removed (Shader in binary file)

## Coming soon:
* Move camera position in 3D window
* Better handling of adding bones
* adding animation creator
* Support of COLLADA dae format
* DirectX 11 => DirectX 12 engine
